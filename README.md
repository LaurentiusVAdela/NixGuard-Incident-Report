# NixGuard Incident Report 🛡️

## Overview  
This repository contains a **detailed incident report** analyzing a **simulated security incident** using **NixGuard**, a GUI-based security monitoring tool. The report documents **threat detection, network traffic analysis, attacker attribution, and incident response measures**, demonstrating **cybersecurity analysis skills** in a controlled environment.

## 🔍 Key Highlights  
✅ **Simulated attack scenario** in a **virtual lab environment**  
✅ **Detection of internal reconnaissance activity** (ARP scanning)  
✅ **File integrity analysis** and **malware verification**  
✅ **Firewall and access control hardening** for threat mitigation  
✅ **Post-incident recovery and security enhancements**  

## 📂 Files in This Repository  
- `NixGuard_Incident_Report.pdf` – Full incident report detailing findings, analysis, and remediation steps.
- `README.md` – This file.

## ⚡ Tools & Technologies Used  
- **NixGuard** – Security monitoring tool  
- **Wireshark** – Network traffic analysis  
- **Nmap** – Host discovery and scanning  
- **Metasploit** – Exploitation framework  
- **Windows PowerShell & CMD** – Command-line analysis  
- **Kali Linux Terminal** – Attacker machine simulation  

## 📌 Key Findings  
1️⃣ **Reconnaissance Detected** – ARP scanning revealed internal network mapping attempts.  
2️⃣ **Suspicious File Identified** – A potential payload was found but later verified as empty.  
3️⃣ **Attacker Attribution** – The source IP and MAC address were traced to an internal device.  
4️⃣ **Firewall & Network Security Enhancements** – MAC filtering and access control measures were implemented.  
5️⃣ **Incident Response & Recovery** – The system was isolated, cleaned, and re-secured.

## 📖 How to Use This Report  
If you are a **cybersecurity student or professional**, you can use this report as a **reference for incident response documentation**, **network forensics analysis**, or **security monitoring improvements**.

## 🎯 Future Improvements  
- **Enhancing NixGuard’s file-based threat detection**  
- **Automating real-time alerting mechanisms**  
- **Implementing machine learning for anomaly detection**
